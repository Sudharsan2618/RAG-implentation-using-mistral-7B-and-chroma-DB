# RAG-implentation-using-mistral-7B-and-chroma-DB
Use this repository to learn the RAG implementation in mistral 7B using  chroma DB.


This repository contains an example code snippet demonstrating the usage of Language Chain, a Python library for natural language processing tasks.

# Installation
To run the example code, you need to install the required Python packages. You can do this using pip:

# bash
Copy code
pip install langchain sentence-transformers chromadb

# Usage
Authentication Setup:

Before using the Hugging Face models, you need to set up authentication by providing your API token. You will be prompted to enter your token securely using the getpass function.

Loading Data:

The example code loads data from a Google Spreadsheet using the WebBaseLoader from langchain.document_loaders.

Splitting Text:

The text is then split into smaller chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from langchain.text_splitter.

Embedding Text:

The text chunks are embedded using Hugging Face models through HuggingFaceInferenceAPIEmbeddings from langchain.embeddings.

Vector Store Creation:

A vector store is created from the embedded text chunks using Chroma from langchain.vectorstores.

Model Configuration:

The Hugging Face model is configured using HuggingFaceHub from langchain.llms. You need to provide the repository ID and other relevant parameters.

Retriever Configuration:

The vector store is converted into a retriever using as_retriever method.

Question Answering:

Finally, a question is asked to the model using RetrievalQA from langchain.chains.

Output:

The response from the model is printed.

# Notes
Ensure that you have set up proper authentication and provided the required API token.
Update the query prompt and other parameters as needed for your specific use case.
